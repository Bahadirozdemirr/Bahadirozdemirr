  Hello, I am Bahadır Özdemir, I graduated from the Computer Programming department in 2024 and I have been working as a Web developer for 2 years. I decided to step into the software world with the values ​​I learned and the experiences I gained throughout my education and professional experiences.

I continue to improve myself in this field with great enthusiasm. Currently, I am increasing my competencies in the software industry by working on technologies such as JavaScript, C#, React.js, HTML, CSS, .NET Core Web API and Blazor.

As someone who is open to new ideas and technologies, my desire to constantly learn continues to provide me with better opportunities. I aim to contribute to innovative projects by constantly updating and improving myself in this dynamic and rapidly developing sector.

You can always reach me to communicate and discover new projects together. <br/><br/>
